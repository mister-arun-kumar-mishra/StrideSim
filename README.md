Theo Jansen Mechanism refers to a specific type of kinetic sculpture created by Dutch artist Theo Jansen. These sculptures are often referred to as "Strandbeests," which is a Dutch term that translates to "beach animals." Jansen's creations are intricate and large-scale mechanical structures that are designed to move in a lifelike manner, often imitating the walking motion of animals.
